"""
Check the dimension trueness of a Zivid camera.

This example shows how to verify the local dimension trueness of a camera.
If the trueness is much worse than expected, the camera may have been damaged by
shock in shipping or handling. If so, look at the correct_camera_in_field sample sample.

Note: This example uses experimental SDK features, which may be modified, moved, or deleted
in the future without notice.
