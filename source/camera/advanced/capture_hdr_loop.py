"""
This example shows how to cover the same dynamic range in a scene with different acquisition settings.

This possibility allows to optimize settings for quality, speed, or to find a compromise. The camera captures multi
acquisition HDR point clouds in a loop, with settings from YML files. The YML files for this sample can be found under
the main instructions for Zivid samples.
