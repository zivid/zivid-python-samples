## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to use Zivid SDK to work with [Point
Cloud](https://support.zivid.com/latest//reference-articles/point-cloud-structure-and-output-formats.html)
data.

-----

Tip:

If you prefer watching a video, our webinar [Getting your point cloud
ready for your
application](https://www.zivid.com/webinars-page?wchannelid=ffpqbqc7sg&wmediaid=h66zph71vo)
covers the Point Cloud Tutorial. .. rubric:: Prerequisites

  - Install [Zivid
    Software](https://support.zivid.com/latest//getting-started/software-installation.html).
  - For Python: install
    [zivid-python](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python#installation)

## Frame

The `zivid.Frame` contains the point cloud and color image (stored on
compute device memory) and the capture and camera information. Capture
^^^^^^^

When you capture with Zivid, you get a frame in return.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/camera/basic/capture.py#L20))

``` sourceCode python
with camera.capture(settings) as frame:
```

Check
[capture\_tutorial](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master/source/camera/basic/capture_tutorial.md)
for detailed instructions on how to capture.

### Load

The frame can also be loaded from a ZDF file.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/basic/file_formats/read_iterate_zdf.py#L14-L16))

``` sourceCode python
data_file = get_sample_data_path() / "Zivid3D.zdf"
print(f"Reading point cloud from file: {data_file}")
frame = zivid.Frame(data_file)
```

## Point Cloud

### Get handle from Frame

You can now get a handle to the point cloud data on the GPU.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/basic/file_formats/read_iterate_zdf.py#L19))

``` sourceCode python
point_cloud = frame.point_cloud()
```

Point cloud contains XYZ, RGB, and SNR, laid out on a 2D grid.

For more info check out [Point Cloud
Structure](https://support.zivid.com/latest//reference-articles/point-cloud-structure-and-output-formats.html).

The function `zivid.frame.point_cloud()` does not perform any copying
from GPU memory.

-----

Note:

The handle from `zivid.frame.point_cloud()` is available instantly.
However, the actual point cloud data becomes available only after the
processing on the GPU is finished. Any calls to data-copy functions
(section below) will block and wait for processing to finish before
proceeding with the requested copy operation.

For detailed explanation, see [Point Cloud Capture
Process](https://support.zivid.com/latest/academy/camera/point-cloud-capture-process.html).

### Copy from GPU to CPU memory

You can now selectively copy data based on what is required. This is the
complete list of output data formats and how to copy them from the GPU.

| `numpy.ndarray([height,width,4], dtype=uint8)`                                                                                        | `PointCloud.copy_data("bgra")`    | 4 bytes        | 9 MB       |
| `numpy.ndarray([height,width,4], dtype=uint8)`                                                                                        | `PointCloud.copy_data("srgb")`    | 4 bytes        | 9 MB       |
| `numpy.ndarray([height,width], dtype=float32)`                                                                                        | `PointCloud.copy_data("snr")`     | 4 bytes        | 9 MB       |
| `numpy.ndarray([height,width], dtype=[('x', '<f4'), ('y', '<f4'), ('z', '<f4'), ('r', 'u1'), ('g', 'u1'), ('b', 'u1'), ('a', 'u1')])` | `PointCloud.copy_data("xyzrgba")` | 16 bytes       | 37 MB      |

Here is an example of how to copy data.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/basic/file_formats/read_iterate_zdf.py#L20-L21))

``` sourceCode python
xyz = point_cloud.copy_data("xyz")
rgba = point_cloud.copy_data("rgba")
```

#### Memory allocation options

In terms of memory allocation, there are two ways to copy data:

  - The Zivid SDK can allocate a memory buffer and copy data to it.
  - A user can pass a pointer to a pre-allocated memory buffer, and the
    Zivid SDK will copy the data to the pre-allocated memory buffer.

## Transform

You may want to
[transform](https://support.zivid.com/latest//academy/applications/transform.html)
the point cloud to change its origin from the camera to the robot base
frame or, e.g., [scale the point cloud by transforming it from mm to
m](https://support.zivid.com/latest//academy/applications/transform/transform-millimeters-to-meters.html).

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/advanced/hand_eye_calibration/utilize_hand_eye_calibration.py#L117))

``` sourceCode python
point_cloud.transform(transform_base_to_camera)
```

## Downsample

Sometimes you might not need a point cloud with as `high spatial
resolution (High spatial resolution means more detail and less distance
between points)` as given from the camera. You may then
[downsample](https://support.zivid.com/latest//academy/applications/downsampling.html)
the point cloud.

-----

Note:

[Monochrome
Capture](https://support.zivid.com/latest/academy/camera/monochrome-capture.html)
is a hardware-based subsample method that reduces the resolution of the
point cloud during capture while also reducing the capture time.

-----

Downsampling can be done in-place, which modifies the current point
cloud.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/advanced/downsample.py#L61))

``` sourceCode python
point_cloud.downsample(zivid.PointCloud.Downsampling.by2x2)
```

It is also possible to get the downsampled point cloud as a new point
cloud instance, which does not alter the existing point cloud.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/applications/advanced/downsample.py#L55))

``` sourceCode python
downsampled_point_cloud = point_cloud.downsampled(zivid.PointCloud.Downsampling.by2x2)
```

Zivid SDK supports the following downsampling rates: `by2x2`, `by3x3`,
and `by4x4`, with the possibility to perform downsampling multiple
times.

## Normals

Some applications require computing
[normals](https://support.zivid.com/latest//academy/applications/normals.html)
from the point cloud.

([go to
source](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python-samples/tree/master//source/camera/advanced/capture_hdr_print_normals.py#L48-L49))

``` sourceCode python
print("Computing normals and copying them to CPU memory")
normals = point_cloud.copy_data("normals")
```

The Normals API computes the normal at each point in the point cloud and
copies normals from the GPU memory to the CPU memory. The result is a
matrix of normal vectors, one for each point in the input point cloud.
The size of normals is equal to the size of the input point cloud.

## Visualize

Having the frame allows you to visualize the point cloud.

No source available for {language\_name} You can visualize the point
cloud from the point cloud object as well.

No source available for {language\_name} For more information, check out
[Visualization
Tutorial](https://support.zivid.com/latest/academy/applications/visualization-tutorial.html),
where we cover point cloud, color image, depth map, and normals
visualization, with implementations using third party libraries.

## Conclusion

This tutorial shows how to use the Zivid SDK to extract the point cloud,
manipulate it, transform it, and visualize it.
